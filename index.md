### Hello, welcome to my webpage! 
 
<p align="left" > 
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Economics at the University of Oslo. I received my PhD in Economics from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in 2024. During my PhD, I visited the Economics Department at UC Berkeley.
</p> Find here my [CV](https://ludelgad.github.io/files/Delgado_CV.pdf).

I am broadly interested in labor economics and applied microeconomics. My current research focuses on immigration, minimum wages, and monopsony power. I study how workers, firms, and markets respond to shocks to analyze these topics.
